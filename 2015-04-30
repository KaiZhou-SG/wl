Topics to discuss with Growth Venture
 
1 About your hardware device:

a My understanding of the 250 chars limitation is that:
  (1) the length of the message BODY cannot exceed 250 characters.
  (2) and special characters such as a blank in the message body will be 
    counted as one character.
  (3) the message HEAD is not counted into the 250 characters limitation.
   Am I correct?
  P.S. Are there limitations on the total length of the Message Head?
  
b Truncation: 
    See from the screen-shots in your latest document, I think the 
  mechanism of truncation is your MDT display extracts the first 250 characters,
  and leave out the other characters. 
    Am I correct?
  
2 For Trip Instruction messages:

a We will add short labels to the message body, e.g.:
  cont:APL2024^sealAPL2024^frm:stopA^to:stopB
    As saw from the above example, cont, seal, frm, to are short labels, this 
  is for the drivers to understand the message body.
    We will use ^ as the separator among multiple properties.
b As we will have multiple planners to send Trip Instructions
    So when the driver sends Trip Update messages back to our planner, we want
  the Trip Update messages go to the right planner.
    Can we add a field called planner_id to the HEAD of the Trip Instruction and
  Trip Update messages?

3 For TU01 messages:

a The same reason as stated above, we propose a planner_id to be added to the
  Head of Trip Update messages.
b There are two Trip Update messages in your sample:
  01 means the trip is started
  07 means the trip is completed
    We propose your side to be open to other trip status, such as Trip 
  Instruction is rejected, traffic-jam, failed, and so on...
c Still, we propose using ^ as the separator, as we concern that the message 
  body may contain ~ also.
