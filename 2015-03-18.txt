In the morning:

1 Finish the experiment with the simple web service application, so that it can
 perform CRUD operations
2 Review the infrastructure of the simulator, and then review the class diagram
 as well as the database table design, but don't change the design for now. For
 the moment, it's more important to demonstrate the concept instead of creating
 a perfect system.
3 Make sure the simulator is compilable, review the function:
 SetConnectionStringForMS()

In the afternoon:

4 Refer to the experience of paragraph 1, finish one circle of message flow wi-
 th CRUD operations.
5 Try to complete the front end for the planner role.
