In the morning:

1 Review what I've done and what I've learned yesterday.
  1.1 I have a installation log while I work yesterday.
  1.2 I have a note on whatever new knowledge I gained.
  1.3 I review those notes and logs the other day, in this way I enhance what
I've learned day by day.

2 Continue with the django web application.
  2.1 I have to learn a bit Python first, but not too much, quickly I'll
walk through the tutorials on the official site. Always keep in mind that
the core value of a programmer is his ability to do business, not writing
codes!!
  2.2 Also making notes on what I learn on Python.

3 Think about what I've already known about Python the programming language, 
and what I should learn about it.

In the afternoon:

4 Exchange ideas with Mr. Lam and Soon and Gerry, on handing over my work.
5 Organize my data on the disk, back up my personal data, delete unnecessary
data.
6 Report to Mr. Lam.
