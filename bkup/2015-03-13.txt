1 revise my resume
2 learn how to publish an asp.net web application to iis 
3 learn how to consume the asp.net web application published to iis
4 continue with finishing the infrastructur of the simulator
5 update the status to Mr. Lam

notes:

1 made this change to static ip machine:
  set <section name="handlers" overrideModeDefault="allow"/>
  on file: %windir%\system32\inetsrv\config\applicationHost.config 
2 to publish a web site is simply the process of copying compiled asp.net source codes
 to a directory, the only difference is that that directory will later be 
 referenced by the IIS as the web_root, so it's equal that manually copy and paste
3 it's better to learn Apache instead of IIS to grasp the basic concepts of a web 
 server
