In the morning:

1 Check what I need to finish today.
2 Review the codes for retrieving reports:
  2.1 aspx --> .js --> aspx.cs --> stored procedure --> db
  2.2 debug the work flow of retrieving a daycare cumulative via the above
routine.
3 Double check what columns do I need to retrieve for the report I'm doing
today.
4 Check the DB ER diagram, and figure out how to retrieve those columns I
need.
5 Make a coding plan and start coding.
