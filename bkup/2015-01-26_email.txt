Hi Mr. Lam,

I'm changing my codes and database tables to the updated design, need 1 day(Monday) to finish and test it.

The target is still to do a testing with Growth Venture for the first round, to do that I need to:
  a) finish my codes / database changes(Monday)
  b) create a server listening to the messages forwarded by Growth_Venture from MDT(Tuesday) and give them the Interface of it(Tuesday)
  c) (Growth_Venture agrees on our interface, and finishes their client side(MDT + GV_Client)), then start testing

I try to keep to the above target.
