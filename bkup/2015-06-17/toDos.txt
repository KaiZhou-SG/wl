1 I've signed the contract with accionlabs, under which I'll work for NCS DBS
project.
2 accionlabs is going to apply a work pass for me, and will update me within 3
working days.
3 While waiting for the update from accionlabs, I'll still keep learning
ASP.NET and SQL Server database, and look for other job opportunities.
