How to start up the TransportPlanningUI program:

>> When integrated with FreightMaster
  1 Current, FreightMaster only provides 3 arguments:
    a) user id, it's the application user id as well as the database login id
    b) sql-server-address\sql-server-instance-name
    c) sql-server-database name
  2 I also need a web service address when startting up, now I decided to read
  the web serivce address from the .ini file, instead of passing it from the
  FreightMaster via arguments.  

>> On local testing:
  1 Start it with TransportMainMenuUI
  2 Pass exactly the same 3 arguments from FreightMaster
  3 Read the .ini file to obtain the web service address

>> Conclusion:
  The arguments of starting up the TransportPlanningUI program remains unchanged,
and add a piece of code to read the .ini file obtaining the web serivce address.
