this is the deployment plan for deploying the simulator to uss for demo

>> the components of the simulator:

1 sql server
2 uat database --> make a copy of uat database for the simulator only
3 iis
4 web service application files(for publishing the web service)
5 transport applications

>> files needed to prepare before deploying

1 sql scripts 
2 web service application files
3 transport applications
4 this document

>> steps to deploy the Simulator to USS 

1 login to uss testing server(if they have a testing server, otherwise, install to production server)
2 back up a latest version of the uat database 
3 create an empty new database, call it uat database2 hereafter
4 restore the backup file to the new empty database, and use it for deploying the simulator
5 run t-sql scripts to the uat database2
6 install iis, create a website and create a virtual folder 
7 create a folder on the server drive, point the virtual folder to this folder, set up the bindings of the    web site plus applications
8 perform a trail of the above deployment plan on the testing machine in ipl office

>> notes on implementation of the above plan:

1) fix the table names, as well as the corresponding source codes
2) fix other mismatching issues on the script
3) add logic for sea-export 2nd leg messages
4) do some testing

>> notes on deploying mss to Z30-A119

steps:

1) think about the connectivities among the plannerUI, driverUI and the ws
2) think about the how to implement the connectivities, and make them configurable
3) make a design on how to implement a configurable mss
4) implement the design
5) deploy it to Z30-A119
