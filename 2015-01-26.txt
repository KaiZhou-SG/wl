First priorities:
1 Finish my base classes design
2 Finish my database tables design
(there are only a few fields are not clear, it does not affect the whole design)

In the morning:

1 Reconsider the classes design and database tables design
2 Revise the technical document
3 Review my design, and make sure it's good enough to coding

In the afternoon:

3 Start coding
4 Do some testing
5 If having time, learn something on how to create an HttpClient to post objects
6 Update the status to Mr. Lam
