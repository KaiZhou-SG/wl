1 Entity Framework is an Object Relational Mapping framework, it maps between
in memory objects and database tables, in order to reduce manual work
including:
  > hand writing T-SQL queries to retrieve data
  > create objects in memory
  > use retrieved data to initialize those objects

2 How to use EF?
  2.0 Schema First, Model First and Code First.
    Schema First --> create database tables first
    Model First --> manipulate the model(edmx) files first 
    Code First --> creating entity classes first.

  2.1 NuGet, use NuGet to add EF reference to current project
  2.2 Add Data -> ADO.NET Entity Data Model
  2.3 Set up the ADO.NET Entity Data Model
    > Connection string to the SQL Server
    > Choose a specific database on that SQL Server
    > Store the database connection string in the Web.Config file with a name
     for use in future.
    > Choose interested tables, views, foreign keys and so on...
    > .designer.cs file
    > Compile the solution first, before using the ADO.NET Entity Data Model
  2.4 Navigation property
  2.5 Gridview control: Template(can drage and drop another gridview control
into the template column)
  2.6 Eval method, Eval('Employee') --> the Employee is the navigation
property.
  2.7 Include, of the datagridview control property tab, set the Include
property to the Navigation property(which is Employee).
  2.8 Add bund column(a sub set of all columns of another table(the Employee
table).

  >>> Model First
  1.1 Create an empty model file
  1.2 Add Entities to the model file, and set the properties such as primary
key and add association(which is the navigation property)
  1.3  The connection string stored in Web.Config file is important.
