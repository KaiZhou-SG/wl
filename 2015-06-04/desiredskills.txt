Is it possible for me to manage the above skills within 7 days? or how many
days do I need?

JavaScript: 
 1 the basic syntax, 1 day
 2 functions, 1 day
 3 objects and prototype, 1 day
    --> 3 days

jQuery:
 1 basic syntax, 1 day
 2 other usage, 2 days
    --> 3 days

ASP.NET MVC
  2 days

EntityFramework
  2 days

Complex T-SQL queries
  1 day

SQL Server Reporting Services
  1 day

CSS
  1 day

HTML
  1 day

14 days in total.

>> Is 14 days acceptable? Or how to make it acceptable?

1 First of all, it's necessary to master all the above desired skills to have
a good job.
2 So I must work very hard to master all the above skills in a very short
time, let it be 14 days.
3 Do I start to look for jobs after those 14 days? 
  > NO, I'll focus on looking for jobs, and at the meantime, I learn those
   skills.
