Some advice i would like to share with the folks when searching for a job.

Some common errors people are doing:
1) Mass sending resume to every company they can find on various online jobportals

Reason: By sending out to many companies, you are allowing yourself to be exposed to companies, 
who might or might not hire you but this personal vital information of yours could be harvested 
for future reference by companies for unethical purposes in the future.

Advice: I strong advocate jobseekers to call into the company and look for the HR personnel for 
the position you are interested with which they are advertising.
Note, never call in blindly into a company asking for a position, make sure they are looking for
 cadidate the position you are seeking, if not you stand a high chance to be rejected.


2) A last minute made resume without vital information for HR personnel to look into and for comparison purpose.

Reason: A resume represents you, it speaks alot about you as a person and is 1 of the most 
decisive tool a HR will use to determine if you are the one they are looking for.
E.g, a resume with messy alignment shows you are not meticulous with your work and messy. 
Job description is too brief or even non-existent shows your insincerity in applying for that position. 
This is easily the most important but also the most common downfall of very good calibre candidate.

Advice: There is no standard format for a good resume, every industry has different style. 
Stick to your style but make sure have all the pertaining information needed. A well taken passport 
photo inside with all your job history and job descriptions in details to "up-sale" yourself. 
Make sure your alignment and font to be standardize throughout. 
Always provide credible reference if possible. K
now what you are applying for and have the information that
boost your reputation to be inside your job description or in the achievement section.


3) Never use a recruitment firm as they are lousy and inefficient, a blood sucker.

Reason: A recruitment firm is a company, definitely revenue is needed for successful placement in order to be in the business.
They can be of real help to you if uses them correctly.

Advice: Choose a recruitment firm which concentrate in the industry you are working or looking into. 
Every recruitment firm has a niche. Look for the right one to work with definitely will be beneficial in finding yourself a job or opens up to option.
