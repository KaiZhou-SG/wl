Lesson One:

1 The protential problems with lists:
  1.1) The essence of real world data is not simply a list
  1.2) If we put all data in a list, we will have these problems:
    > redundance(which means a piece of data appears in multiple list items)
    > deletion anomaly 
        --> have to delete at multiple rows, or
        --> delete it at one row, but it is needed at other rows
    > insertion anomaly
        --> cause null values(or empty cells)  
    > update anomaly
        --> have to udpate multiple rows
    all the above problems cause data to be not integrity

2 The reason for using a database
  2.1) database not only stores data, but also provides other functions
  2.2) relational database is designed to handle complex relationships between
data, which is the case in real world

3 How related database tables avoid problems associated with lists
  Create 3rd Normal Formed database tables instead of Lists
  1st Normal Form is a valid relation(Relational database table)
  2nd Normal Form is that based on 1st Normal Form, all non-unique attributes depend on entire primary
key, not partially
  3rd Normal Form is that based on 2nd Normal Form, no trivistial
attributes(which means, no attributes depends on other non-primary keys
attributes)

4 The components of a database system
  A database system is not only a database, it's a management system,
providing lots of management functions, including multiple databases

5 The elements of a database
  Tables
  Functions
  Rules
  Constraints
  Views
  StoredProcedures

6 The purpose of a database management system

7 The functions of a database application
