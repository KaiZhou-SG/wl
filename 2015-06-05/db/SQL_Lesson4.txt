Three Stages of Database Development

1 Requirement Analysis Stage
  -->  
  Sources of requirements
  User Interviews
  Forms
  Reports
  Queries
  Use Cases
  Business Rules
  Observation
  JAD Sessions --> all stakeholders in the single room to discuss

2 Component Design Stage
  >> ER Model
    --> Entities
    --> Attributes --> used to describe the entity
      ** Identifiers(keys)
      ** Non-key attributes
    --> Relationships

  >> Entity Class vs. Entity Instance
  >> Relationships between entities
    --> Degree of the relationship defines the number of entity classes that
participate in the relationship
      ** Degree 1 is a unary relationship --> relate to itself
      ** Degree 2 is a binary relationship(the most common in relationship
databases) --> two entities involved
      ** Degree 3 is a ternary relationship --> 3 entities involved
  >> Binary relationship
   --> 1 : 1(One-to-One)
   --> 1 : N(One-to-Many) the most common
   --> N : N(Many-to-Many) --> require a third table as a lookup table







3 Implementation Stage
  --> Realworld datbase tables, functions
