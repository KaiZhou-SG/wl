  1.1 I chose django-cms to learn, because:

    1.1.2 Python is a well-supported language itself, and there's a lot of good
  text-books depending on Python

  cms application, unlike, the only option is Microsoft Azure
2 Try creating a small cms application
  2.1 Learn how to read the reStructuredText documents
  2.2 Install django-cms to my Ubuntu
  2.3 Try creating a small django-cms project
  2.4 Try to deploy it 
3 Spend 30 minutes with Gerry on how to debug a asp.net web service with Fiddler
