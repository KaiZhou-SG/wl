1 Continue with Service Assignment Booking page: --> DONE
  1.1 Refer to what Min Qi has done, to change my three columns
    >> Need to observe what has Min Qi has changed, as well as the new
     structure
     ******* what Min Qi has done is separate the columns(if there are more
than one column, and each column has its own title, and the top title is set
to h1. And for each individual column, Min Qi either made use of the existing
div class or created new div classes, and adjust the width of each column, so
as to align with the top header of the page******
    >> Need to reconsider my case, and consider how to apply the same style to
     my page.
    ***** first of all, I found two pages Min Qi has done which are similar to
my two pages currently working on. Then I used Firefox web developer tool to
analysis what style did Min Qi apply to the page.

2 Continue with Invoices Listing Page: --> DONE 
  2.1 Rearrange the three rows on the header
    >> See if it's possible to re-create the table, if decided to do so, make
      sure I have a copy of the existing codes before overwriting.
    >> 
  ***** I rewrote the table layout for the 3 row searching criteria.

3 Deploy the changes before 11:30 a.m. to the stages server -> DONE
  3.1 Need to confirm with Min Qi with her way of deploying, but I observe her
way of deploying first.
