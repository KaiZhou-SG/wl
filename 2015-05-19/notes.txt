1 I added a style: style="width:550px" to the containContainer760 when the
page is not wide enough.
  >> I may need to remove it after the new master page is done.
2 I also reduced the width of the bar(called Add), because it reaches out of
the range when I add the above style to contentContainer760.
3 I'm not able to convert asp.net button into JavaScript button.  

not so new concepts:

1 Server controls
2 Button
3 Master Page
